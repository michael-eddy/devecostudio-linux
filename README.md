Thanks to [Cris.Q](https://crisq.top/blog/deveco_linux_porting_notes) for the original porting notes that inspired this project.

This is an Arch Linux PKGBUILD that packages DevEco Studio (Huawei's IDE for HarmonyOS development) from its Mac DMG distribution, bringing it to Linux with the help of JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA native launcher and JBR.

It is not an official package. It is not endorsed by Huawei or JetBrains.

## Status

Everything works except the previewer. If you find any problems, file an issue.

Both `x86_64` and `aarch64` (ARM) are packaged; the target architecture only
picks which Command Line Tools zip, IDEA archive and CPython build are used.

If Huawei ships a native Linux build, this project will be archived.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you plan to use this project, reading the full README is strongly recommended; the collapsed sections are optional reading as needed.

## Building

Always check `PKGBUILD` yourself before using.

<details>
<summary><b>Build locally (any distro)</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

First, download two files from Huawei's website:

1. **DevEco Studio ${pkgver} for Mac** — either the x64 or the ARM build; only
   platform-independent files are taken from it, so either one works.
2. **Command Line Tools for Linux ${pkgver}**, in the build matching your
   architecture: `x86_64` → *Linux (x64)*, `aarch64` → *Linux (ARM64)*.

Place both `.zip` files next to the PKGBUILD. `makepkg` needs them **renamed**
to `devecostudio-mac.zip` and `commandline-tools-linux-x64.zip` /
`commandline-tools-linux-arm64.zip`; `build.sh` also accepts Huawei's original
versioned filenames.

    # Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/alex3236/devecostudio-linux.git
    cd devecostudio-linux

    # Checkout latest tag (skip if you accept untested changes)
    git fetch --tags
    git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))

What to do next depends on your distro:

<details>
<summary><b>I'm on Arch Linux</b></summary>
<br><ul>

    makepkg -si

The host architecture picks the sources, so this builds the aarch64 package on
Arch Linux ARM and the x86_64 package everywhere else.

The two Huawei zips are not checksum-verified (`SKIP` in `sha256sums`): their
download URLs are signed and short-lived, and Huawei republishes the same
version with different bytes. The IDEA and CPython tarballs are verified; if
one of those reports a mismatch, update the sums with:

    updpkgsums

</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I'm on another distro</b></summary>
<br><ul>

You will need these dependencies:

    bsdtar or unzip, 7z, jq, python3, curl, binutils, patchelf

To also build .deb/.rpm packages:

    nfpm, gettext

Then:

    # Show the build script's help
    ./build.sh -h

    # Example: build the tarball
    ./build.sh

    # Example: build the tarball and an rpm package
    ./build.sh --rpm

The target defaults to the host architecture; `--arch=aarch64` on an aarch64
machine is the same build. Building for the *other* architecture is refused:
the JBR, the launcher, node, the Emulator and the SDK host toolchains all come
from target-arch archives.

Note: `build.sh` does **not** verify the two Huawei zips (they are `SKIP` in
`sha256sums`); IDEA and CPython are downloaded with checksum verification.

</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Build online (GitHub Actions)</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

The same build can be run in GitHub Actions:

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Open the **Actions** tab, select **Build DevEco Studio PKGBUILD** and click **Run workflow**.
3. Optionally, "Use workflow from" a tagged release.
4. Pick **`target_arch`** (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) and fill in the two download URLs:
   - `mac_zip_url` — URL of the Mac zip
   - `cli_zip_url` — URL of the Linux Command Line Tools zip *matching that architecture*
5. Optionally override the version and checksums (leave empty to keep the defaults):
   - `pkgver` — e.g. `6.1.1.280`
   - `mac_zip_sha256` / `cli_zip_sha256` — SHA256 of the two zips; leave empty to skip verification (the PKGBUILD's `SKIP` default)
6. Choose which artifacts to build — unchecking one shortens the run, and
   `.rpm` in particular adds the 16 GB swapfile and the slowest step:
   - `make_arch`, `make_deb`, `make_rpm`, `make_tarball` (all on by default)
7. When the run finishes, download the artifact matching your platform:
   - `devecostudio-arch-x86_64` — Arch package
   - `devecostudio-deb-<arch>` — Debian/Ubuntu package
   - `devecostudio-rpm-<arch>` — Fedora/RHEL package
   - `devecostudio-tarball-<arch>` — for any other distro

Each run builds one architecture. `aarch64` runs on GitHub's ARM runner, where
makepkg is not available, so no Arch package is produced — on Arch Linux ARM,
build locally with `makepkg -si`.

A GitHub account can use Actions for free on public repositories.

## Installing

This package targets Arch Linux (the makepkg build); the `.deb`/`.rpm`
builds cover Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 22.04+ and Fedora / RHEL; the tarball
works on any Linux.

    # Arch
    sudo pacman -U devecostudio-*.pkg.tar.zst

    # Debian / Ubuntu
    sudo apt install ./devecostudio_*.deb

    # Fedora / RHEL
    sudo dnf install ./devecostudio-*.rpm

<details>
<summary><b>Other distros (via tarball)</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

Extract the tarball and set up the launcher manually:

    sudo tar -xzf devecostudio-<ver>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz -C /opt
    sudo ln -s /opt/devecostudio/bin/devecostudio.sh /usr/local/bin/devecostudio
    sudo desktop-file-install /opt/devecostudio.desktop

You also need the runtime dependencies (package names vary by distro):
`libxss`, `libxtst`, `nss`, `alsa-lib`, `libxcrypt-compat`, `freetype2`,
`libpulse`, `bzip2`. Chinese input support needs `fcitx5`. Unlike the Arch
package, the bundled CLI tools are not linked into `/usr/bin` — call them
by full path under `/opt/devecostudio/tools/bin/`.

</td></tr></thead></table>
</details>

## Usage

Launch DevEco Studio with whatever you are familiar with (start menu / dock / command line).

### CLI tools on PATH

The IDE needs the bundled Huawei command-line tools at runtime, and they
also work standalone from a terminal. By default the package symlinks them
into `/usr/bin`:

- Always exposed: `devecostudio`, `hdc`
- Exposed by default: `hvigorw`, `ohpm`, `hstack`, `hcodelinter`, `hemulator`, `harktsdoc`;

`Emulator`, `codelinter` and `arktsdoc` are prefixed to avoid possible
collisions.

<details>
<summary><b>Adjusting the symlink behavior</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

Both behaviors are controlled by variables at the top of the PKGBUILD:

- `_expose_cli_tools=true`
    - If set to `false`, the by-default exposed commands are not symlinked into `/usr/bin`
    - They are still callable by full path under `/opt/devecostudio/tools/bin/`
- `_hprefix_generic_tools=true`
    - If set to `false`, no `h` prefix is added; `codelinter` and `Emulator` are exposed under their original names

Both only apply to the Arch package. The `/usr/bin` links in the `.deb` and
`.rpm` are declared statically in `nfpm.yaml` — always the `h`-prefixed
names — and the tarball ships no `/usr/bin` links at all.

</td></tr></thead></table>
</details>

### Extra SDKs (older versions)

The bundled SDK is HarmonyOS 26.0.0 (Release). An older SDK (e.g. 6.1.1
Release) can be installed alongside and used per project — useful for
reproducing issues or building against an older API level.

<details>
<summary><b>How?</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

1. Download the corresponding CLI tools package, in the build matching your
   architecture (the SDK carries host toolchains such as BiSheng clang);
2. Install the SDK into the IDE directory with the following command:
    ```shell
    # Install SDK from a Huawei CLI zip (needs sudo)
    sudo /opt/devecostudio/bin/install-extra-sdk.sh /commandline-tools-linux-x64-6.1.1.280.zip
    # on aarch64: commandline-tools-linux-arm64-<ver>.zip
    ```

3. Set the compile SDK in your project:
    ```json5
    "compileSdkVersion": "6.1.1(24)",
    "targetSdkVersion": "6.1.1(24)"
    ```

</td></tr></thead></table>

Installing an older SDK also patches two things so it can actually be used:
hvigor's `compileSdkVersion` validation and the IDE's project-sync check
(both are hardwired to the bundled SDK version). A default install stays
pristine; the patches are applied by `install-extra-sdk.sh` and re-applied
automatically when the package is upgraded while an extra SDK is present.

Note: source code using API 26-only interfaces (e.g. newer camera APIs)
will not compile against 6.1.1 — adjust or guard the code accordingly.
</details>

### Emulator

The emulator works, but before first use you must accept the software
agreements and download a system image. The IDE's Device Manager lists the
cloud images (non-public HarmonyOS images need a Huawei account signed in);
the command line downloads them anonymously.

<details>
<summary><b>How?</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

    # List available images
    hemulator -imageList

    # Phone images only
    hemulator -imageList -deviceType phone

    # Use jq for a concise list
    hemulator -imageList -deviceType phone | jq '.[].osVersion'

    # Install an image
    hemulator -install -deviceType phone -osVersion "HarmonyOS 6.1.1(24)"

Once installed, you can create, manage and start emulators from the
IDE's Device Manager.

</td></tr></thead></table>

### DevEco CLI

With Huawei's DevEco CLI, you and your AI Agent can effortlessly handle project initialization, building, signing, and debugging, alongside documentation lookup.

This project provide environment support for DevEco CLI. Simply set `DEVECO_CLI_STUDIO_PATH=/opt/devecostudio`.

### Previewer

The previewer is unavailable. Huawei has not yet ported the Rosen
rendering engine to Linux.

This also means `hvigorw test` (local unit tests run through the previewer)
cannot pass. It should fails within seconds.

## How does this work?

The PKGBUILD extracts the Mac DMG and takes the platform-independent parts,
then replaces the macOS-specific bits (launcher, JBR, native libraries) with
their Linux counterparts from IntelliJ IDEA. The vmoptions and
product-info.json are transformed on the fly so the IDE knows it's running
on Linux.

The result is a native-feeling DevEco Studio that runs without Wine or
containers.

Why repackage from the Mac version? Huawei distributes DevEco Studio for
Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Linux distribution has two problems: the
installer is an `.exe` that is hard to extract, and the packaged version
lags behind in updates. The Mac DMG is trivially extractable and contains
all the cross-platform files we need.

<details>
<summary><b>Component details</b></summary>
<table><thead><tr><td>

### The emulator

Three emulator-related quirks deserve a mention.

First, Huawei's code only
distinguishes Mac from non-Mac, and the non-Mac branch hardcodes the
`Emulator.exe` filename. On Linux that file does not exist, which broke the
Device Manager and debugging. The package fixes this with a symlink:
`Emulator.exe -> Emulator` in `tools/emulator/`.

Second, the Device Manager lists the cloud system images — the IDE is
patched to report `osType` `windows` to Huawei's server, which is what
Huawei's own Linux CLI emulator does too.

Third, the emulator's software agreements: the IDE launches the emulator
binary directly, and if the agreements were never accepted it waits
silently for a `y`. The `Emulator` wrapper auto-accepts them on first use
(`hemulator ...` when `~/Library/Caches/Huawei/Emulator26.0/.emu_config`
does not exist runs `-license accept` and exits), so by the time you use
the IDE the agreements are in place. To opt out of the auto-accept,
truncate that `.emu_config` file.

### Wayland

Most of the IDE runs fine under Wayland, but the CEF-based user interfaces
— the project structure dialog, markdown preview, and similar — crash their
GPU process under Wayland (`eglCreateWindowSurface` segfault). The launcher
wrapper works around this by forcing the X11 backend by default
(`unset WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `GDK_BACKEND=x11`), which makes every CEF page
render correctly through XWayland.

If you prefer to run under Wayland natively, set
`DEVECO_DISABLE_X11_WORKAROUND=1` before launching — but expect the CEF
pages to be blank or broken.

The launcher also enables JCEF's headless + out-of-process rendering by
default (equivalent to `ide.browser.jcef.headless.enabled` and
`ide.browser.jcef.out-of-process.enabled` in the registry), which fixes
blank CEF pages in some environments. Set `DEVECO_DISABLE_JCEF_HEADLESS=1`
before launching to opt out.

### Software rendering (LLVMpipe)

When the vendor DRM driver fails to load — common on ARM SBCs, where Mesa
prints `failed to load driver: sunxi-drm` and `glxinfo -B` reports
`Accelerated: no` — Mesa falls back to CPU rasterization. On that fallback
the GL path still paints the first frame, but clears the window to black on
every repaint; moving the mouse over a button is enough to lose the window.

If `glxinfo -B` reports `Accelerated: no` (or, without `glxinfo`, when no
`/dev/dri/renderD*` node exists) the launcher passes
`-Dskiko.renderApi=SOFTWARE -Dsun.java2d.opengl=false`, keeping Compose and
Java2D off the broken GL path.

Override the detection:

    DEVECO_RENDER_MODE=software devecostudio   # force software rendering
    DEVECO_RENDER_MODE=gl devecostudio         # keep GL when detected as software

### HiDPI

XWayland does not report per-monitor scale to the JVM (it reports 1.0), so
on a HiDPI screen the IDE would lock its UI scale to 1.0 — too small. The
launcher reads the compositor's real scale (`wlr-randr`), rounds it to the
nearest quarter step, and injects it as `-Dide.ui.scale` via a user
vmoptions overlay.

Override the value or disable the detection:

    DEVECO_UI_SCALE=1.2 devecostudio   # use 1.2 as-is
    DEVECO_UI_SCALE=off devecostudio   # leave scaling to the JVM

You can also set the scale manually via the IDE's *Help → Edit Custom VM
Options*. For more, see [the IDEA HiDPI
documentation](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007994999-HiDPI-configuration).

## License situation

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Huawei.

<details>
<summary><b>Terms, redistribution and component licenses</b></summary>
<br><table><thead><tr><td>

DevEco Studio is a commercial product owned by Huawei. Before using it, you agree to the HUAWEI DevEco Studio User Agreement (reproduced in LICENSE.huawei). A few clauses worth noting:

- **Clause 1.6** grants a "limited, non-exclusive, free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable" license to use DevEco Studio solely for developing applications that run on OpenHarmony-compatible devices and/or HarmonyOS.

- **Clause 1.7(h)** prohibits reverse engineering, decompiling, or creating derivative works.
- **Clause 1.7(i)** prohibits distributing, selling, or transferring the service.

This packaging project extracts platform-independent files from the Mac DMG and recombines them with Linux-native components (launcher, JBR, native libraries) from IntelliJ IDEA. The Java bytecode and resources are not modified, but configuration files are transformed. This likely constitutes "modification" and "merging" under clauses 1.7(f) and 1.7(h).

What this means in practice:
- Building this package for personal use is what the author does, and the project exists to document that process.
- Distributing the resulting package to others is likely not permitted under Huawei's terms.
- If you have legal concerns, consult Huawei's official licensing at https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-studio/ and your own legal counsel.

### Licensing of the packaging scripts

The files that make up this packaging project are provided under the BSD 2-Clause license.

They are not part of DevEco Studio and carry no restrictions from Huawei's terms.

### Licensing of bundled components

- DevEco Studio itself and its plugins are proprietary works of Huawei.
- JetBrains Runtime (JBR) is GPLv2 with the classpath exception, based on OpenJDK.
- IntelliJ IDEA Community components are available under Apache 2.0.
- Various third-party libraries bundled with DevEco Studio carry their own licenses.
